constructors:
1. Default methode when a object of a class is called
like when a car is created it will have default color , fuel

2. constructors will have same name as class




class student{

	public student(){
		int name = "Kiran";

	}
	
	// overloaded constroctor
	public student(Stirng name){
	
	}
}


class studentTest{
	p.s.v.m(String[],args){
	
	student s = new student();
	}
}

3. constructor will not have return type , dont even write void.

4. constructor can be overloaded i.e with different parameter..
